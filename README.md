# amazon_review_sentiment
In this project, I performed sentiment analysis on 2 million Amazon reviews. Reviews with 3 or fewer stars were negative, reviews with 4 or 5 stars were positive. Data cleaning and feature engineering was done with NLTK. I did sentiment prediction with various models including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Perceptron with Sci-kit Learn. I also tried RNN and RNN with attention which improve the prediction accuracy from 71% to 89%.
