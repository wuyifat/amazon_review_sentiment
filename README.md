# amazon_review_sentiment
In this project, I performed sentiment analysis on 2 million Amazon reviews. Reviews with 3 or fewer stars were negative, reviews with 4 or 5 stars were positive. Data cleaning and feature engineering was done with NLTK. In [amazon_classic.ipynb](amazon_classic.ipynb) I did sentiment prediction with various models including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Perceptron and SVM with Sci-kit Learn. I also tried LSTM and LSTM with attention in [amazon_nn.py](amazon_nn.py) which improved the prediction accuracy from 71% to 91%.
